# Submitting your labs

## ðŸ’ª Do your work
For your 301 lab assignments, we will be using the git flow outlined in the [GIT_FLOW](GIT_FLOW.md) file.


## ðŸ‘Œ Ensure your submission is ready
For your work to be eligible for a grade, you must:
1. Be passing our class `eslint`
    - No warnings or errors
1. Have a clear and useful commit history
    - Your commit messages describe what changes occur in the commit

If your submission does not meet these requirements, you will be asked to fix the issues and resubmit.
- To fix the first issue (not passing eslint), edit your code until it passes.
- To "fix" your commit history, comment in your PR what you would change your commit messages to in order to be more descriptive.


## ðŸ™Œ Submit your lab
To submit your work you will:
1. **In GitHub**
    - Make a pull request (PR) to the class lab's repo. Name it with your and your pair's name, e.g. `sj-haley`.
    - In the PR's description, include a filled in [PR_TEMPLATE](PR_TEMPLATE.md).
1. **In Canvas** 
    - Submit the link to your PR.
    - Answer a few questions about your time spent working on the lab.
        - How long did you spend working on the lab?
        - What was the hardest or easiest part of the lab?
        - What was something from the lab that sparked your interest or curiosity?
